## This workflow aims to run the Application Signals end-to-end tests as a canary to
## test the artifacts for App Signals enablement. It will deploy the CloudWatch Agent
## Operator and our sample app and remote service onto a native K8s cluster, call the
## APIs, and validate the generated telemetry, including logs, metrics, and traces.
## It will then clean up the cluster and EC2 instance it runs on for the next test run.
